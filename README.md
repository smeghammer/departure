# Phobos: Threshold

An Episode 1 replacement by Smeghammer.

This is my first foray into level development in the PK3 format. Must say, much easier than a big-arse .wad file. Lovin' the ease of namespacing stuff...

Anyway, it has fairly extensive use of Realm 667 custom monsters, and my first crack at a DECORATE customisation (an enhanced Baron of Hell).

## E1M1
### Garden of Evil
Fairly standard entyway map, based around a big outdoor courtyard.

## E1M2
### Blast Furnace
A foundry. I realised after I'd finished it's very influenced by Doom 2016 first map.

## E1M3
### Loading Dock
After you leave the blast furnace, you must load all the crates onto a ship. But watch the rats... There,s a secret exit if you push.

## E1M9
### A Glimpse of Hell...
A hellish marbled crypt. With some REALLY nasty Barons.
